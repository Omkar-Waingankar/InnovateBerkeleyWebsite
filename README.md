Innovate Berkeley, proudly sponsored by the Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology, is UC Berkeley's foremost design sprint for social good. We challenge students at Cal to channel their creativity, enthusiasm, and skills to develop implementable, human-centered solutions for problems within our campus. The program consists of a 3-week design process guided by our core team, UC Berkeley faculty & staff, and concludes with an overnight innovation summit/hackathon.

This website was redesigned and restructured to engage innovators at Cal, convey Innovate Berkeleyâ€™s mission, and direct
students to our Spring workshops and speaker series.
