			Innovate Berkeley is the culmination of the combined efforts from UC Berkeley’s administration, faculty, staff, students, and alumni. Innovate Berkeley is much larger than the single event. It’s the <b>selfless, innovative energy</b> that has continuously propelled this university forward as a leading institution for higher education. Innovate Berkeley compresses that energy into an innovation hackathon-like event, with the goal of <b>creating tangible technological and non-technological solutions to mitigate problems on campus</b> that assist our peers, faculty and administration face.
