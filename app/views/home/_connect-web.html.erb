			UC Berkeley Alumni will serve as the guiding third party <b>mentors</b> who will give unbiased thoughts and suggestions about improvements to certain solutions. For the alumni who can be a full mentor for Innovate Berkeley, our teams will host <b>weekly phone meetings</b> with them as they tackle their prompts. During the innovation hackathon event, there will be a variety of times for which a mentor can sign up to <b>host workshops.</b>
