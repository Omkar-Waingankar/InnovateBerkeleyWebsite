							<p>Hey innovators! My name is Namrata and I am a 2nd year majoring in Public Health, and minoring in Math and Science Education.

							<p>Hey! My name is Evan Corriere, a Computer Science major from Southern California. I quickly found an amazing community here in Innovate Berkeley and have really enjoyed having the ability to help innovators! As leader of the Internal Team, I work on connecting Berkeley Students to speakers, managing our Core Team, and planning for the next Innovation Summit. Outside of Innovate Berkeley, I skateboard through campus and go to the gym in order to justify my ice cream addiction. </p>

							<p>Hello! My name is John Wood and I am a freshman studying EECS here at Cal. Outside of classes, I spend my time as the Assistant Risk Manager at Chi Psi fraternity, as an Assistant Director at National High School Model UN, and help out coordinating the student organizations in SCETSA. In my free time, I enjoy long distance running, reading political news articles, and spending time with friends. At IB 2017, I worked on a prototype for a more streamlined group-oriented calendar for Golden Bear Orientation, and I can’t wait to work on the core team this year to help a new round of participants make their ideas into reality.</p>

							<p>Hey! My name is Aatif Jiwani and I am a freshman studying EECS at Cal. Furthermore, I hope to pursue my passion for business and study Business Administration at the Haas School of Business. Currently, I spend my time working for Antigravity Investments as a UI/UX design to build a platform that auto-invests your money based on a custom investing algorithm. Also, I co-founded a startup called BearCrawl with Jack Jones, which was our IB 2017 idea, that is dedicated to facilitating communication between clubs on campus and Berkeley students. I really enjoy skiing, playing or watching baseball, playing split-screen Xbox with my friends and roommates, and going on spontaneous adventures.</p>
