							<p>Hey! My name is Evan Corriere, a Computer Science major from Southern California. I quickly found an amazing community here in Innovate Berkeley and have really enjoyed having the ability to help innovators! As leader of the Internal Team, I work on connecting Berkeley Students to speakers, managing our Core Team, and planning for the next Innovation Summit. Outside of Innovate Berkeley, I skateboard through campus and go to the gym in order to justify my ice cream addiction. </p>
